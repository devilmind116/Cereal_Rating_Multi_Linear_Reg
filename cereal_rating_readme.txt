STEPS: 
1. import dataset
2. data adjusting (removing irrelevant data identified easily)
3. finding null cells
4. Finding correlations
5. Plotting Correlations
6. Removing data as per least correlations
7. Trains Test split
8. Check regressor score
9. If regularization needed: i.e. if regressor score is above 90
	i. Change alpha to obtain a desired score within range of a efficient fit.


1. Why pearsonr?
Cause there is no outliers. (outliers -> unrealistic values)
